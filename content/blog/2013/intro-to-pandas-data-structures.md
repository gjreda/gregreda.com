Description: Part one of a three part introduction to the pandas library. Geared towards SQL users, but is useful for anyone wanting to get started with pandas.

_UPDATE: If you're interested in learning pandas from a SQL perspective and would prefer to watch a video, you can find video of my 2014 PyData NYC talk [here](http://reda.io/sql2pandas)._
