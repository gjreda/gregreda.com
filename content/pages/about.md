I’m a data science consultant and developer based in Chicago, where I help clients effectively utilize data to answer questions, solve problems, and grow their business. 

Previously, I was the first data hire at GrubHub, where I led the data team for three years. I’ve also worked at [Datascope](http://datascopeanalytics.com/) and [PwC](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/index.jhtml).

I'd love to work together. [Get in touch](mailto:gjreda@gmail.com?subject=Work).
