I’m a data science consultant and developer based in Chicago, where I help clients effectively utilize data through analytics, statistics, and machine learning. 

Previously, I was the first data science hire at [GrubHub](http://www.grubhub.com/), where I led the team focused on data research, A/B testing, and product analytics.

I've also spent time at [Datascope](http://datascopeanalytics.com/), where I helped an NBA team with draft preparation and scouting, and [PwC](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/index.jhtml), where I focused on analytics related to fraud, investigations, and litigation.

I'd love to work together. [Get in touch](mailto:gjreda@gmail.com?subject=Work).
